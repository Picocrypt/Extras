This repository contains extra features and extensions that aren't part of the main project but are still useful and worth sharing. Existing extras can be found in their respective folders, and new extras should be pushed into this repository as its own folder as well. Extra features and extensions are not held up to the same scrutiny as the main project, so exercise caution when using them. Anyone can add an extra feature/extension into this repository after three approving PR reviews. Have fun!
